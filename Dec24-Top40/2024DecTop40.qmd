### Data

[GHCNr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GHCNr) v1.4.5: Provides an interface to the [Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily) which contains daily summaries of weather station data worldwide. GHCNd is accessed through the [web API](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/services/data/v1) which premits downloading, filtering, and to aggregation at montly and annual scales. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GHCNr/vignettes/daily.html).

[OncoDataSets](https://cran.r-project.org/package=OncoDataSets) v0.1.0: Offers a rich collection of data focused on cancer research, covering survival rates, genetic studies, biomarkers, and epidemiological insights and and includes datasets on various cancer types such as melanoma, leukemia, breast, ovarian, and lung cancer, among others. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OncoDataSets/vignettes/Introduction_to_OncoDataSets.html)

[spanishoddata](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spanishoddata) v0.1.0: Provides access to origin-destination (OD) data from the [Spanish Ministry of Transport](https://www.transportes.gob.es/ministerio/proyectos-singulares/estudios-de-movilidad-con-big-data/opendata-movilidad) and proides features to simplify the management of large datasets and process them with a `duckdb`  interface. Extensive documentation is available [here](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/index.html). There are four vignettes including [Quickly get daily data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spanishoddata/vignettes/quick-get.html).
