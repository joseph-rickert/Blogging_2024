### Agriculture

[pacu](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pacu) v0.1.44: Provides support for a variety of commonly used precision data science agriculture operations including functions to download and process raw satellite images from [Sentinel-2](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/OData.html),  functions to [download vegetation index statistics](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Statistical.html) for a given period of time, without the need to download the raw images, and functions to visualize weather data in a historical context. There are five vignettes including an [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacu/vignettes/pacu.html),  [Satellite data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacu/vignettes/pacu_sat.html) and [Weather data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacu/vignettes/pacu_weather.html).

GHCNd is accessed through the [web API](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/services/data/v1) which premits downloading, filtering, and to aggregation at montly and annual scales. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GHCNr/vignettes/daily.html).

[OncoDataSets](https://cran.r-project.org/package=OncoDataSets) v0.1.0: Offers a rich collection of data focused on cancer research, covering survival rates, genetic studies, biomarkers, and epidemiological insights and and includes datasets on various cancer types such as melanoma, leukemia, breast, ovarian, and lung cancer, among others. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OncoDataSets/vignettes/Introduction_to_OncoDataSets.html)

![](Oncodata.png){fig-alt="Distripution of miRNA types over the years"}

[spanishoddata](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spanishoddata) v0.1.0: Provides access to origin-destination (OD) data from the [Spanish Ministry of Transport](https://www.transportes.gob.es/ministerio/proyectos-singulares/estudios-de-movilidad-con-big-data/opendata-movilidad) and proides features to simplify the management of large datasets and process them with a `duckdb`  interface. Extensive documentation is available [here](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/index.html). There are four vignettes including [Quickly get daily data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spanishoddata/vignettes/quick-get.html).

### Networks

[tna](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tna) v0.3.0: Provides tools for performing Transition Network Analysis (TNA) to study relational dynamics, including functions for building and plotting TNA models, calculating centrality measures, and identifying dominant events and patterns. See [Saqr et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15486) for details on TNA. There is a [Getting Started Guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tna/vignettes/getting_started.html) and ttwo additional vignettes with examples.

### Statistics


[catalytic](https://cran.r-project.org/package=catalytic) v0.1.0: Catalytic prior distributions which integrate observed data with synthetic data generated from a simpler model's predictive distributions may improve estimation accuracy and stability in statistical modeling. See [Huang et al. (2020)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1920913117) and [Li and Huang (202)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01411) for background and the vignettes [catalytic_cox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/catalytic/vignettes/catalytic_cox.html), [catalytic_glm_binomial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/catalytic/vignettes/catalytic_glm_binomial.html), and [catalytic_glm_gaussian](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/catalytic/vignettes/catalytic_glm_gaussian.html).
