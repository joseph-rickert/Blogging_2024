### AI

[groqR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=groqR) v0.0.1: Provides a suite of functions and `RStudio` Add-ins leveraging the capabilities of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to support R developers. Features include text rewriting, translation, and general query capabilities. Programming-focused functions provide assistance with debugging, translating, commenting, documenting, and unit testing code, as well as suggesting variable and function names. Look [here](https://github.com/GabrielKaiserQFin/groqR) for examples.

### Computational Methods




### Data

[clintrialx](https://cran.r-project.org/package=clintrialx) v0.1.0: Provides functions to fetch clinical trial data from sources like \[ClinicalTrials.gov\](https://clinicaltrials.gov/} and the Clinical Trials [Access to Aggregate Content](https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/) database that supports pagination and bulk downloads. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clintrialx/vignettes/usecase-doc.html).

[ColOpenData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ColOpenData) v0.3.0: Provides tools to download and wrangle Colombian socioeconomic, geospatial,population and climate data from [DANE](https://www.dane.gov.co/) at the National Administrative Department of Statistics and [IDEAM](https://ideam.gov.co) at the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies. It solves the problem of Colombian data being issued in different web pages and sources by using functions that allow the user to select the desired database and download it without having to do the exhausting acquisition process. There are six vignettes including [How to download climate data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ColOpenData/vignettes/climate_data.html) and [Population Projections](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ColOpenData/vignettes/population_projections.html).

See [Mayer, Tan & Zuraw](https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~cjmayer/papers/cmayer_et_al_maxent_ot_accepted.pdf) and the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maxent.ot/vignettes/maxent-ot_vignette.html) for an overview.

### Pharma

[sdtm.oak](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sdtm.oak) v0.1.0: Provides a framework to develop CDISC, [SDTM](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig) datasets in R and potentially automate the process. There are six vignettes including on on [Algorithms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdtm.oak/vignettes/algorithms.html).

### Statistics

[dpasurv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dpasurv) v0.1.0: Provides functions to implement dynamic path analysis for survival data via Aalen's additive hazards model. See [Fosen et al., (2006)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10985-006-9004-2) for details. There is an [oveview](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dpasurv/vignettes/dpa.Rmd) and a [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dpasurv/vignettes/ggplot_demo.html) on plotting with `ggplot2`.

### Utility

[pikchr]()V0.97 : Provides an interface to [pikchr](https://pikchr.org) q markup language for creating diagrams within technical documentation. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pikchr/vignettes/Examples.html) for examples.

![](../#2/pitchar.png){fig-alt="Example block diagram"}

[rnix](<https://cran.r-project.org/package=rix>) v0.12.4: Provides tools to run the [nix package manager](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)>). There are fifteen vignettes including a [Getting Started Gude](<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rix/vignettes/a-getting-started.html>).

[qs2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qs2) v0.1.1: Provides tools to efficiently serialize `R` objects using one of two compression formats: the `qs2` format, which uses R serialization while optimizing compression and disk I/O, and the `qdata` format which uses custom serialization to achieve slightly faster performance and better compression. `qs2` format can be directly converted to the standard `RDS`. See the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qs2/vignettes/vignette.rmd)

### Visualization

[ggalign](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggalign) v0.0.4: Implements an extension to `ggplot2` that offers various tools for organizing and arranging plots including the ability to consistently align a specific axis across multiple `ggplot` objects. There are seven vignettes including [Examples](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggalign/vignettes/complete-examples.html) and [Heatmap Layout](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggalign/vignettes/heatmap-layout.html).
