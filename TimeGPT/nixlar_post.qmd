This post is a first look at [Nixtla's](https://docs.nixtla.io/) `TimeGPT` generative, pre-trained transformer for time series forecasting. Nixtla's website provides a considerable amount of explanatory material, documentation, and code examples in Python. The [`nixlar`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nixtlar) package wraps the Python code to provide an R interface. The package documentation for version 0.6.2 doesn't fully the R functions, but the vignettes provide sufficient code examples to get started.
