### Machine Learning

[metasnf](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/metasnf) v1.1.2: Provides a framework for transforming multi-modal data into a wide range of similarity networks using the similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm introduced by [Wang et al. (2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2810) and the meta clustering approach of [Caruana et al. (2006)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4053039). Core functionality includes easy customization of distance metrics, clustering algorithms, and SNF hyperparameters. There are twenty-two vignettes including [The Settings Matrix](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metasnf/vignettes/settings_matrix.html) and [A Complete Example](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metasnf/vignettes/a_complete_example.html).

### Statistics (Continued)

[BayesGP](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesGP) v0.1.3: Implements Bayesian hierarchical models with flexible Gaussian process priors, focusing on extended latent Gaussian models and incorporating various Gaussian process priors for Bayesian smoothing. See [Zhang et al. (2023)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09622802221134172). [Zhang et al. (2024)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2289532), and [Stringer, Brown, and Stafford (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/77/3/785/7445030?login=false) for the methods used. There are three vignettes including [Partial Likelihood](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesGP/vignettes/BayesGP-Partial_Likelihood.html) and [Fitting sGP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesGP/vignettes/BayesGP-sGP.html).

[distfreereg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distfreereg) v1.0.1: Implements distribution-free goodness-of-fit regression testing for the mean structure of parametric models introduced in [Khmaladze (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10463-021-00786-3). There is an [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distfreereg/vignettes/v1_introduction.html) and four additional vignettes including [Comparing Distributions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distfreereg/vignettes/v2_compare.html).

![](distfree.png){fig-alt="Estimated density plot"}

[GeoTox](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GeoTox) v0.2.0: Implements a method to connect spatiotemporal exposure to individual and population-level risk via source-to-outcome continuum modeling. See [Messier, Reif, and Marvel (2024)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.24314096v2) and [Eccles et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722060041?via%3Dihub) for the theory. There is an [Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GeoTox/vignettes/introduction.html) and a vignette on [Package Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GeoTox/vignettes/package_data.html).

![](GeoTox.png){fig-alt="Spatial contraction maps"}

[OPSR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=OPSR) v0.1.2: Implements ordinal probit switching regression models (a Heckman type selection model with an ordinal selection and continuous outcomes). See [Wang & Mokhtarian (2024)](ordinal probit switching regression models - a Heckman type selection model with an ordinal selection and continuous outcomes. Different model specifications are allowed for each treatment/regime. For more details on the method, see Wang & Mokhtarian (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.tra.2024.104072> or Chiburis & Lokshin (2007) <doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700202>.) and [Chiburis & Lokshin (2007)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1536867X0700700202) for details and [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OPSR/readme/README.html) for an example.











### Time Series








### Utilities

 



### Visualization

[plotthis](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plotthis) v0.4.0: Extends `ggplot2` to provide a high-level API with wide range of options to create publication-quality plots effortlessly. It is particularly useful for creating complex plots with multiple layers, facets, and annotations. Look [here](https://pwwang.github.io/plotthis/) for examples.

[RegrCoeffsExplorer](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RegrCoeffsExplorer) v1.1.0: Implements a visualization tool that offers a nuanced understanding of regression dynamics, going beyond traditional per-unit interpretation of continuous and categorical variables th highlight the impact of unit changes as well as larger shifts such as interquartile changes. See the vignettes [BetaVisualizer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RegrCoeffsExplorer/vignettes/BetaVisualizer.html) and [OddsRatioVisualizer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RegrCoeffsExplorer/vignettes/OddsRatioVisualizer.html).
